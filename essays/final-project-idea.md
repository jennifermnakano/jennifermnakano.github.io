## Rate my Manoa
Authors: Jennifer Nakano, Jordan Wong, Evan Tahara

## Overview
The Problem: Some students don't know what they're getting into when registering for classes. Certain classes, professors, or available class times can be a lot to consider. 

The Solution: Our app allows students to rate every class in the UH Manoa system and give their thoughts and advice to students who are deciding between certain classes.

## Mockup page ideas

- Mockup pages:
- Home Page
- Admin Home Page
- Class Search Page
  - Categories:
    - Professor
    - Difficulty
    - Similar Courses/Other Options 
    - Comments about the course
- Advice Page

## Use case ideas
- New user goes to the home page, logs in, sets up profile(standing, major, etc.)
- Admin user goes to home page, logs in, goes to admin home page, edits site
- User goes to home page, logs in, finds the class they are considering, reads reviews
- User goes to home page, logs in, gives advice about a class they took recently

## Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
- Add a scheduling page that includes STAR/Class Availabiity data so that students can see how certain classes will fit in their schedule
- Include a favorite class/professor page
- Innclude a contact page aspect for professors in case students need to get in touch with them
