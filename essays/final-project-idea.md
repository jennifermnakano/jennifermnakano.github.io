## Rate my Manoa
Authors: Jennifer Nakano, Jordan Wong, Evan Tahara

## Overview
The Problem: Some students don't know what they're getting into when registering for classes, dorms, or just looking for something to eat. Certain classes, dorms, or looking for what to eat can be a lot to consider.  

The Solution: Our app allows students to rate every class, dorm, and vendors at UH Manoa and give their thoughts and advice to students who are contemplating their options.

## Mockup page ideas

Mockup pages:
- Home Page
- Admin Home Page
- Class Search Page
  - Similar Courses/Other Options 
  - Comments about the course
  - Advice for the course
  - Rating Categories:
    - Professor
    - Difficulty
- Dorm Search Page
  - Rating Categories:
    - Cleanliness
    - Environment
    - Vibes :)
- Vendor Search Page
  - Menu
  - Rating Catgories:
    - Overall
    - Price 


## Use case ideas
- New user goes to the home page, logs in, sets up profile(standing, major, etc.)
- Admin user goes to home page, logs in, goes to admin home page, edits site
- User goes to home page, logs in, finds the class/dorm/food place they are considering, reads reviews
- User goes to home page, logs in, gives advice about a their experience with a class/dorm/food place

## Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
- Random generator for what to eat (for indecisive people)
- Add a scheduling page that includes STAR/Class Availabiity data so that students can see how certain classes will fit in their schedule
- Include a favorites page
- Include a contact aspect, for the class search page, for professors in case students need to get in touch with them
