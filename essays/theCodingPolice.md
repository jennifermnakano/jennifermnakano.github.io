Similar to how laws keep the balance of society in check, coding standards maintain our harmony as computer geeks. However, we’re only human…we can make mistakes, get lazy, and sometimes we just hate the constraints of having to follow rules.


## ESLint to the Rescue!
Luckily for us, we have an, as I call it, “code police” to help us obey these coding “laws”. ESLint is a plugin used to analyze JavaScript code and identify any sections of the program that don't follow the coding standards. Fixing these issues can be as simple as the click of a button. For minor errors such as “trailing spaces not allowed” (a space character at the end of a line), we can easily fix these kinds of errors by hovering over the area and clicking “fix”. In more complex cases, where there’s no simple fix, we might have to go in and fix some of the detected errors. This may seem a bit irritating, but in the end…we have a watchful eye helping us follow coding standards so we can be better developers.

## The Satisfaction of the Green Check
Since grade school, we were conditioned to be unsatisfied with a red X… the wrong answers on our math test were marked with the red X and our essays were flooded with red squiggly lines. In general, we don’t usually like red X’s, so when I see that red X in the top right of my screen, it’s unsettling and I want to get rid of it right away. Not only does obtaining the green checkmark mean that I don’t have to see a red X, it also ensures that my code is following the coding standards (which, I guess, is also satisfying).

## A Matter of Job or No Job!
All jokes aside, coding standards are essential in the world of programming because it makes code cleaner, more readable, maintainable, and can highlight errors in our code. Employers often look for developers who write code that can be reused, read, and understood by others. So although it may be a hassle, obeying the rules enforced by the coding police could be a deciding factor in my career as a software developer.
